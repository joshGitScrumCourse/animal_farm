         "Size":"Giant pandas stand between 2 and 3 feet (60 to 90 centimetres) tall at the shoulder (on all four legs), and reach 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 meters) long. Males are larger than females, weighing up to 250 pounds (113 kilograms) in the wild. Females rarely reach 220 pounds (104 kilograms). Newborn pandas are about 1/900th of the size of their mothers—about the size of a stick of butter.",
         "Characteristics":"The low nutrient value of bamboo figures prominently in the biology of the giant panda. They have extremely powerful jaws and associated muscles to crunch through the woody stems of bamboo. Each hand bears a specialized metacarpal bone in the wrist that functions as a thumb would in humans, to allow them to grasp the circular bamboo stalks. Their hair is very dense, conserving their body heat in their cold habitats. Their iconic coloration remains a mystery to scientists but may aid with camouflage.",
         "Breathing":"Pandas breathe using their lungs, just like humans.",
         "Lifespan":"Scientists are not sure how long giant pandas live in the wild, but they are sure it is shorter than life spans in zoos with an average a lifespan of 14-20 years. Chinese scientists have reported zoo pandas as old as 35. The Smithsonian National Zoo's Hsing-Hsing died at age 28 in 1999.",

         ]
      },
      "Behaviour":{  
         "Food":"When living in the wild, giant pandas secure their food source by foraging. It is a type of directed wandering in which the giant panda is constantly in search of plant material to consume. Researchers believe the animals follow one of the basic rules of foraging: use the least amount of energy to consume the greatest amount of food. Because the birth rate among giant pandas is very low, zoo researchers take extra precaution in feeding the young born in captivity. These baby pandas getting their food from their caretakers receive a specialized milk formula of boiled rice and synthesized vitamins. This formula is designed to mimic the milk they would obtain from their mother for the first six months of life if living in the wild. Anywhere between seven and nine months, the young pandas are offered the more tender portions of bamboo along with sugar cane, carrots, apples and sweet potatoes.",
         "Protection":" A fully grown panda is far too formidable a foe for most predators, but some animals can prey on cubs. Potential predators include jackals, snow leopards and yellow-throated martens, all of which are capable of killing and eating panda cubs. Giant pandas are solitary and peaceful animals, which will usually avoid confrontation, but if escape is impossible, they will certainly fight back. And as cuddly as they may look, pandas can protect themselves as well as most other bears by using their physical strength, and powerful jaws and teeth. And while their large molar teeth and strong jaw muscles are designed for crushing bamboo, they can deliver a very nasty bite. In addition, giant panda are excellent climbers, with cubs able to clamber up trees when they are just 6 months old. They can also swim and, unlike most other bears, do not hibernate for months at time during winter. With all these attributes in their arsenal, fully grown giant pandas can defend themselves against most predators.",
         "Sleeping":"In the wild, giant pandas typically nap between feedings for two to four hours at a time, snoozing on their side, back, or belly, either sprawled or curled up. While a giant panda is resting, it continues to defecate. The number of droppings at a rest site can be used to gauge the relative amount of time a giant panda spent at that site. During a short rest of less than two hours, there are five to ten droppings. Eleven to 25 droppings often accompany rests lasting longer than two hours. Most rest periods are two to four hours in duration but may increase to six or more hours during the summer months.",
