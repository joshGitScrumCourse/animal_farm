They have extremely powerful jaws and associated muscles to crunch through the woody stems of bamboo. Each hand bears a specialized metacarpal bone in the wrist that functions as a thumb would in humans, to allow them to grasp the circular bamboo stalks. Their hair is very dense, conserving their body heat in their cold habitats. Their iconic coloration remains a mystery to scientists but may aid with camouflage.",
