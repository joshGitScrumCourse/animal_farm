Purpose of site: We should do everything we can to save the giant panda because we are the ones that have driven it to the edge of extinction. And because we can. But pandas also play a crucial role in China's bamboo forests by spreading seeds and helping the vegetation to grow. So by saving pandas, we will also be saving so much more. We will be helping to protect not only these unique forests but also the wealth of species that live in them. Want to find out more? Navigate through each page for more information.

<--- Diet Information --->
•	What it eats:  99% Bamboo - Arrow bamboo, black bamboo and water bamboo. Eat almost entirely the leaves, stems and shoots. In spring and summer, they like eating different kind of shoots. In autumn, they enjoy the leaves of bamboo. In winter, their main diet is shoots.
•	How often:  Spend over 10hours a day because they have a shorter gut
•	Amount:  Bamboo contains very little nutrition so they must eat 20 - 40 pounds per day to meet their energy needs and nutrients.

<--- Mating and Reproduction Information --->
•	What is the gestational period of the animal? 95-160 days
•	How many offspring does it typically have at a time? Although females may give birth to two young, usually only one survives.
•	How long do the offspring live with the parents? Giant panda cubs may stay with their mothers for up to three years before striking out on their own.

Other information: 
•	Giant pandas reach breeding maturity between four and eight years of age.
•	They may be reproductive until about age 20. 
•	Female pandas ovulate only once a year, in the spring. 
•	A short period of two to three days around ovulation is the only time she is able to conceive. 
•	Calls and scents draw males and females to each other.

<--- Scientific Name and Classification --->
•	Scientific Name:  Ailuropoda melanoleuca
•	Classification:  Mammal 

Subspecies:  Two subspecies of giant panda have been recognized on the basis of distinct cranial measurements, colour patterns, and population genetics.
•	The nominate subspecies Ailuropoda melanoleuca consists of most extant populations of panda. These animals are principally found in Sichuan and display the typical stark black and white contrasting colors.
•	The Qinling panda, A. m. qinlingensis is restricted to the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi at elevations of 1,300–3,000 m. The typical black and white pattern of Sichuan giant pandas is replaced with a dark brown versus light brown pattern. The skull of Qinling panda is smaller than its relatives, and it has larger molars.

Any other detail on its scientific classification: 
•	Molecular studies indicate the giant panda is a true bear, part of the family Ursidae
•	The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil.
•	A detailed study of the giant panda's genetic history from 2012 confirms that the separation of the Qinling population occurred about 300,000 years ago
