Purpose of site: We should do everything we can to save the giant panda because we are the ones that have driven it to the edge of extinction. And because we can. But pandas also play a crucial role in China's bamboo forests by spreading seeds and helping the vegetation to grow. So by saving pandas, we will also be saving so much more. We will be helping to protect not only these unique forests but also the wealth of species that live in them. Want to find out more? Navigate through each page for more information.

<--- Diet Information --->
•	What it eats:  99% Bamboo - Arrow bamboo, black bamboo and water bamboo. Eat almost entirely the leaves, stems and shoots. In spring and summer, they like eating different kind of shoots. In autumn, they enjoy the leaves of bamboo. In winter, their main diet is shoots.
•	How often:  Spend over 10hours a day because they have a shorter gut
•	Amount:  Bamboo contains very little nutrition so they must eat 20 - 40 pounds per day to meet their energy needs and nutrients.

<--- Mating and Reproduction Information --->
•	What is the gestational period of the animal? 95-160 days
•	How many offspring does it typically have at a time? Although females may give birth to two young, usually only one survives.
•	How long do the offspring live with the parents? Giant panda cubs may stay with their mothers for up to three years before striking out on their own.

Other information: 
•	Giant pandas reach breeding maturity between four and eight years of age.
•	They may be reproductive until about age 20. 
•	Female pandas ovulate only once a year, in the spring. 
•	A short period of two to three days around ovulation is the only time she is able to conceive. 
•	Calls and scents draw males and females to each other.

<--- Animal Habitat Information --->
•	Where on earth is the animal found? Currently, giant pandas are limited to six mountainous areas of south-western China in the provinces of Sichuan, Gansu, and Shanxi. Historical records indicate a much larger distribution, including much of China and portions of Myanmar and Vietnam. 
•	What natural surroundings does the animal need to thrive?  They are native to high-elevation cool mountain forests, in the warmer months they will generally be in their climate-controlled dayroom habitats.
•	Where does the animal make its home? Their preferred bamboo forests are found at elevations between 5,000 and 10,000 feet. Cubs are raised in rocky crevices, dead trees, or caves.

Other Habitat Information
•	They live in temperate broadleaf and mixed forests
•	Pandas play an essential role in the bamboo forests of the Yangtze Basin by spreading seeds as they roam, increasing vegetation.
•	Forest destruction reduces pandas' access to bamboo and prevents mating, and only about 61% of China's panda population is protected by reserves.
•	Roads and railroads are increasingly fragmenting the forest, which isolates panda populations and prevents mating.
•	They once lived in lowland areas, but farming, forest clearing and other development now restrict giant pandas to the mountains.

<--- Scientific Name and Classification --->
•	Scientific Name:  Ailuropoda melanoleuca
•	Classification:  Mammal 

Subspecies:  Two subspecies of giant panda have been recognized on the basis of distinct cranial measurements, colour patterns, and population genetics.
•	The nominate subspecies Ailuropoda melanoleuca consists of most extant populations of panda. These animals are principally found in Sichuan and display the typical stark black and white contrasting colors.
•	The Qinling panda, A. m. qinlingensis is restricted to the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi at elevations of 1,300–3,000 m. The typical black and white pattern of Sichuan giant pandas is replaced with a dark brown versus light brown pattern. The skull of Qinling panda is smaller than its relatives, and it has larger molars.

Any other detail on its scientific classification: 
•	Molecular studies indicate the giant panda is a true bear, part of the family Ursidae
•	The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil.
•	A detailed study of the giant panda's genetic history from 2012 confirms that the separation of the Qinling population occurred about 300,000 years ago

<--- Animal Anatomy and Biology --->
•	Height/Weight/General size info:  Giant pandas stand between 2 and 3 feet (60 to 90 centimetres) tall at the shoulder (on all four legs), and reach 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 meters) long. Males are larger than females, weighing up to 250 pounds (113 kilograms) in the wild. Females rarely reach 220 pounds (104 kilograms).
•	Explanation of significant or unique characteristics: The low nutrient value of bamboo figures prominently in the biology of the giant panda. They have extremely powerful jaws and associated muscles to crunch through the woody stems of bamboo. Each hand bears a specialized metacarpal bone in the wrist that functions as a thumb would in humans, to allow them to grasp the circular bamboo stalks. Their hair is very dense, conserving their body heat in their cold habitats. Their iconic coloration remains a mystery to scientists but may aid with camouflage.
•	How the animal breathes: Pandas breathe using their lungs, just like humans.
•	How long the average animal of this species lives:  Scientists are not sure how long giant pandas live in the wild, but they are sure it is shorter than life spans in zoos. Chinese scientists have reported zoo pandas as old as 35. The Smithsonian National Zoo's Hsing-Hsing died at age 28 in 1999.

Other animal biology
•	The low nutrient value of their food and their low digestive efficiency results in an animal that is constrained to a low-metabolism.
•	This lifestyle explains why giant pandas sleep so often and why they eat such enormous amounts of bamboo.
•	In patches of dense bamboo, an immobile giant panda is nearly invisible, and virtually disappears among snow covered rocky outcrops on a mountain slope.
